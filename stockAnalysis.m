% get data

% split data to X_train, Y_train adn X_test, Y_test

% Find interpolated functions using 3 methods with inputs are X_train and
% Y_train

% Created Y_interpolated x 3 from each interpolated function.

% Calculate root-mean-square-deviation from Y_test and Y_interpolated for
% each Y_interpolated

% Find the min root-mean-square-deviation. Thus, find the best function

% Apply best time to buy and sell stock to Y_interpolated

% Plot three interpolated functions and train and test inputs in a graph
